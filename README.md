# GraphMatrix

## Simplified, efficient sparse matrix representations for unweighted graphs

Implementation of CSC Sparse Matrices representing boolean types.
There is no `nzval` vector; a point is defined or undefined.

## Installation

With Go installed, package installation is performed using go get.

```
go get -u github.com/sbromberger/graphmatrix
```
